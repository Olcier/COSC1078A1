				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>

        <ul>

          <li><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></li>
            <p>Growing up I have always had an interest in computers. I was only two and a half years old when I first got my computer. Looking back now, I would say the games I had played as a kid could
               have inspired me to pursue my interest in IT. Needless to say, I was pretty young when I was first involved with IT.</p>
            <p>Seeing how dynamic and ever-changing the world of IT is, it provides me with new and imaginative ways to learn and grow. A world within a world, even the concept fascinates me, constantly evolving and changing
               to suit our needs. As an introverted person, it has always been a challenge to put my thoughts into words. Sometimes it felt like showing my thoughts
               would have been much more easier. Through IT, I may be able to give form to my thoughts that I can finally show to people.</p>
            <p>In my experience, IT has never been just about computers rather it is all around us. It is on our bedside table when our alarm goes off, it is in our pockets, from hearing aids to the vending machines,
               from air navigation to social networking, IT is always there. It has become such an integral part of our modern society which not only makes our life easy, but has
               become an outright necessity.</p>

          <li><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></li>
            <p>RMIT has a great studying environment, it has also a great respect within the Global rankings when it comes to studying of IT related subjects. RMIT is located at
              the heart of Melbourne which has easy access to every location, and transportation is easily manageable. All these factors led me to choose RMIT to study IT.</p>

			    <li><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
			      <p>In the years that I study here, I expect to enhance my set of skills, learning the ability to work as a part of a team, solving problems and develop my leadership skills which will
               later on help with my career goals. Woking in group projects and getting myself involved in various oppotunities provided by the RMIT alumni would help a great deal with my communication skills. Taking such
               initiative will inturns give life to my ideas, expanding my prospects in the process.</p>

					  <p>There are certain aspects that I value more than others when it comes to finding a job. I would like to adhere to these aspects but realisticly,
               it isn't truely possible to find the "perfect" job. There will certainly be some merits and demerits. So, I do realize that I must go out finding
