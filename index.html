				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>

        <ul>

          <li id="ti"><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></li>
            <p>Growing up I have always had an interest in computers. I was only two and a half years old when I first got my computer. Looking back now, I would say the games I had played as a kid could
               have inspired me to pursue my interest in IT. Needless to say, I was pretty young when I was first involved with IT.</p>
            <p>Seeing how dynamic and ever-changing the world of IT is, it provides me with new and imaginative ways to learn and grow. A world within a world, even the concept fascinates me, constantly evolving and changing
               to suit our needs. As an introverted person, it has always been a challenge to put my thoughts into words. Sometimes it felt like showing my thoughts
               would have been much more easier. Through IT, I may be able to give form to my thoughts that I can finally show to people.</p>
            <p>In my experience, IT has never been just about computers rather it is all around us. It is on our bedside table when our alarm goes off, it is in our pockets, from hearing aids to the vending machines,
               from air navigation to social networking, IT is always there. It has become such an integral part of our modern society which not only makes our life easy, but has
               become an outright necessity.</p>

          <li id="ti"><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></li>
            <p>RMIT has a great studying environment, it has also a great respect within the Global rankings when it comes to studying of IT related subjects. RMIT is located at
              the heart of Melbourne which has easy access to every location, and transportation is easily manageable. All these factors led me to choose RMIT to study IT.</p>

			    <li id="ti"><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
			      <p>In the years that I study here, I expect to enhance my set of skills, learning the ability to work as a part of a team, solving problems and develop my leadership skills which will
               later on help with my career goals. Woking in group projects and getting myself involved in various oppotunities provided by the RMIT alumni would help a great deal with my communication skills. Taking such
               initiative will inturns give life to my ideas, expanding my prospects in the process.</p>

					<li id="ti"><b>Job Description</b></li>
					  <p>There are certain aspects that I value more than others when it comes to finding a job. I would like to adhere to these aspects but realisticly,
               it isn't truely possible to find the "perfect" job. There will certainly be some merits and demerits. So, I do realize that I must go out finding
               jobs with an open mind. However, below are some of the core principals I would like to have in the job that I am taking.</p>
        </ul>
        <section style="margin-left:15px">
        <p><b>Descriptions of My Ideal Job:</b><p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Freedom to pursue my own aspirations.</li>
          <li>Financial Stability.</li>
          <li>Mutual respect and feeling of trust in work mates.</li>
          <li>A sense of growth.</li>
          <li>Work days.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        </section>
      </section>
            <p>From the job descriptions, it is provided that the employer is partnered up with large brands. This inherently will give me some much needed
               challenge that will in return help me grow. Seemingly, they also have team members in every state of Australia which gives a sense of diversity
               in the workplace. Since they are also spread out in so many locations, traveling could always be an option. Being a full-time permanent job gives
               me stability in my financial responsibilities. Working in Security has also been a passion of mine which makes the Job that much appealing to me.
               And ofcourse, free breakfast.</p>

				<ul>
					<li id="ti"><b>Skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</b></li>
					  <p>For the position mentioned, it is preferred if I have experience in IOT. This is a job revolving around the core concept of security, therefore, experience in
               designing secure networks, systems and architectures is required. It is stated that I need to have the ability to read and use the results obtained
               from malicious code, anti-virus software as well as mobile code. In case of disaster, I need to have the knowledge required for recovery, computer
               forensic tools, technologies and methods. For this I need to have direct experience with anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls and content
               filtering. Covering the advanced skills, a strong understanding of web application security, microsoft SQL database security and secure identity management
               is required.</p>
        </ul>
			</section>

      <section>
				<ul>
					<li id="ti"><b>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently possess.</b></li>
					  <p>Starting out, I have a beginner's understanding of IOT and what it's involved with. Studying my current course, I'm gaining a better understanding of database
               and SQL. I am also taking slow steps when it comes to learning security. However, I have no experience regarding what is required but through time and
               practice, gradually I may be able to gain all the required skills inorder to get the job.</p>
        </ul>
			</section>

      <section>
				<ul>
					<li id="ti"><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</b></li>
					  <p>Given my current status, I have to keep studing untill I a get my Bachelors Degree. Within this time I need work hard so I may get an internship which will cover as my experience
               needed to fill in the required position. Meanwhile, I still have to pursue my Masters Degree, and then work into my PhD. By then, I would have sufficient knowledge on the aspects
               that I would be working on giving me the qualifications required to attain the position. This qualification translates to skills which will make me fit, not only for this job, but
               other related jobs as well. As a result, I can cover a wide range of opportunities, broadening my prospects and ideas.
            <p>In order to achieve all of this, I have to get out of my comfort zone in order to face more challenges. If I have plans to work under a corporation, I need to be a team player. I have
               to be persistent in my journey for knowledge. I'm still in the beginner level of my work, but through patience, and hard work, I believe I can gain all the qualities to fill in
               the required position.</p>

               easy going.</p>
