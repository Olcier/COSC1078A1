          <li><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></li>
            <p>Growing up I have always had an interest in computers. I was only two and a half years old when I first got my computer. Looking back now, I would say games might
have played a contributing factor in my interest in IT. Needless to say, I was pretty young when I was first interested in IT. Seeing how dynamic and ever-changing the
world of IT is, it provides me with new and imaginative ways to learn and grow. A world within a world, even the concept fascinates me, constantly evolving and changing
to suit our needs. As an introverted person, it has always been a challenge to put my thoughts into words, so much so that sometimes it felt like showing my thoughts
to them would have been much more easier. Through IT, I may be able to give form to my thoughts that I can finally show to people. In my experience, IT has never been
just about computers rather it is all around us. It is on our bedside table when our alarm goes off, it is in our pockets, from hearing aids to the vending machines,
from air navigation to social networking, IT is always there. It has become such an integral part of our modern society which not only makes our life easy, but has
become an outright necessity.</p>

          <li><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></li>
            <p>RMIT has a great studying environment, it has also a great respect within the Global rankings when it comes to studying of IT related subjects. RMIT is located at
the heart of Melbourne which has easy access to every location, and transportation is easily manageable. All these factors led me to choose RMIT to study IT.</p>

			    <li><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
			      <p>In the years that I study here, I expect to gain a certain set of skills that will later on help me find a good paying job so I can achieve financial solvency and
settle down quietly living a carefree life. I mostly expect to learn how to work as a part of a team. It is also one of my goals to develop my leadership skills while
studying here.</p>
